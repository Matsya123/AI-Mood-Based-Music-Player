# ðŸŽµ AI-Mood-Based-Music-Player

A smart AI-based music player that detects a userâ€™s facial emotion via webcam in real-time and automatically recommends mood-matching music. It uses YOLOv8 for face detection, a CNN model for emotion recognition (FER-2013), and plays music via Python using a Flask GUI.

## ðŸ§ª System Architecture

1. **Webcam** captures face â†’ YOLO detects face.
2. **FER CNN Model** predicts emotion from cropped grayscale face.
3. **Flask Backend** fetches matching song list from emotion dictionary.
4. **Web UI** displays detected emotion and music recommendations.
5. **Pygame** plays the selected audio file.
